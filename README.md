A set of workflows developed for the digitization of biodiversity specimens stored in flat sheets or packets, essentially in vascular and non-vascular plant herbaria. Development of these workflows began with iDigBio's DROID (Developing Robust Object to Image to Data) workshop in May of 2012. In January of 2015, a group of approximately 25 experts representing 15 major NSF-funded projects updated these workflows to reflect advancements and enhancements since the initiation of NSF's Advancing the Digitization of Biological Collections (ABDC) program. Workflow modules are presented in both PDF and DOCX format to facilitate customization for specific institutional implementation.
